  title: Question 1
  description: "The following drawing depicts a soon-to-be DA transition state that
    can be mapped into an hexagonal prism. Choose the correct hexagonal prism orientation
    in which the molecules can be mapped without any rotations.\r"
  prompt: {fileID: 21300000, guid: b8a7ffd3af91a254b8acd5ec0a99c1db, type: 3}
  options:
  - feedback: Incorrect. You would need to rotate either the hexagonal prism or the
      TS approach so they can fit.
