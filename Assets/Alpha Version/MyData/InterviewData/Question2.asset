  title: Question 2
  description: "The following drawing depicts a soon-to-be DA transition state that
    can be mapped into an hexagonal prism. Choose the correct hexagonal prism orientation
    in which the molecules can be mapped without any rotations.\r"
  prompt: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 5651c79acdcbff2418305634542057b9, type: 3}
  options:
  - feedback: CORRECT! The TS approach can be mapped into the hexagonal prism without
      any rotations.
